  <ABF_Thing_Synstruct_Guardstruct.description>These drone synstructs are unique in many ways - programmable for a wide range of tasks both military and civilian in nature, heavily armed and yet disarmingly affectionate, charge-capable and command-responsive - and are thus a well known line of biomimetic. Many serve as companions, as fearsome scouts, as mobile surveillance, or even as sappers.\n\nTheir lethality and violent capabilities have certainly earned them a reputation - a reputation they almost seem keen to keep.</ABF_Thing_Synstruct_Guardstruct.description>
